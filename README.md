## Installation

When used on a local computer through the GitHub repository, here are the steps to follow:
To start using the application, all dependencies need to be installed using the command npm i.
After installation, the Greenhill database needs to be generated by connecting to mySQL adn running the command source db/schema.sql. Once the database created, the data needs to be generated by using the following command in the terminal: node seeds/seeds.js. Then, run node server to have the application started and go to http://localhost:3001/
